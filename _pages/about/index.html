<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hello and Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Connor Shen, and I hail from the vibrant city of Shanghai, China. Currently, I’m a senior student at Fudan University, where I am studying Physics and Data Science.</p> <p>I’m a die-hard tech optimist, deeply convinced of the revolutionary power of large language models(LLM), especially their ‘Superman intelligence’ capabilities. LLMs’ potential to reshape the future captivates me. I’m eagerly experimenting with their application across various fields and also tring to utilize LLMs to play diverse roles. I firmly believe LLM is not just a tool to simplify our daily tasks but a key driver for <strong>enhancing productivity</strong>, <strong>fostering social equality</strong>, and <strong>combating poverty</strong>. I am certain that AI will be a defining force in the future, shaping every aspect of our lives.</p> <p>In my free time, I enjoy swimming alone, playing football with my friends, and listening to music. Nature and travel are my escapes, and recently, I’ve been trying my hand at cooking (trust me, it’s an adventure) and soaking up some philosophy books. I treasure my moments of solitude, yet equally enjoy the warm company of my friends.</p> <p>They say variety is the spice of life, and I’m all for it! I warmly welcome friends from all around the world with different backgrounds to connect and collaborate with me. I’m always open to new ideas and perspectives, so feel free to reach out to me!</p> <h3 id="education-and-career">Education and Career</h3> <h4 id="fudan-university">Fudan University</h4> <ul> <li>Senior Student</li> <li>No. 220 Handan Road, Yangpu District, Shanghai</li> </ul> <h4 id="shanghai-artificial-intelligence-laboratory">Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</h4> <ul> <li>Algorithm Intern at OpenMMLab Team</li> <li>L1 Building, 8F, Longteng Avenue, Xuhui District, Shanghai</li> </ul> <h2 id="my-research-interests">My Research Interests</h2> <ul> <li>In-context learning &amp; Prompt Engineering</li> <li>LLMs Fine-tuning &amp; Application in Various Domains</li> <li>Exploring General AI Agents &amp; Human-AI collaboration</li> </ul> <h2 id="ongoing-projects">Ongoing Projects</h2> <ul> <li>Knowledge-Driven Prompt Learning Approach for depression detection and domain knowledge framework construction</li> <li>Using LLMs as optimizer for Prompt Engineering</li> <li>ToolBench Construction &amp; SFT of LLMs based on ‘ReAct’</li> <li>Evaluation of LLM’s Data Science Capability</li> </ul> </body></html>
