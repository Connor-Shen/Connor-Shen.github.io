Hello and Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Connor Shen, and I hail from the vibrant city of Shanghai, China. Currently, I'm a senior student at Fudan University, where I am studying Physics and Data Science.

My research fervor lies in Prompt Engineering, Fine-tuning and Application of Large Language Models in Different Domians. I'm also exploring the realization of General Artificial Intelligence Agents.

Currently, I serve as an Algorithm Intern at the OpenMMLab team in the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, where my research is centered on Fine-tuning and Evaluation of large language models.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
