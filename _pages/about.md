Hello and Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Connor Shen, and I hail from the vibrant city of Shanghai, China. Currently, I'm a senior student at Fudan University, where I am studying Physics and Data Science.

My research fervor lies in Prompt Engineering, Fine-tuning and Application of Large Language Models in Different Domians. I'm also exploring the realization of General Artificial Intelligence Agents.

Currently, I serve as an Algorithm Intern at the OpenMMLab team in the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, where my research is centered on Fine-tuning and Evaluation of large language models.
