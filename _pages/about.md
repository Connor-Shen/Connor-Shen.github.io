Hello and Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Connor Shen, and I hail from the vibrant city of Shanghai, China. Currently, I'm a senior student at Fudan University, where I am studying Physics and Data Science. hhh

As a **die-hard tech optimist**, I am deeply convinced of the revolutionary potential of large language models (LLMs). My enthusiasm leads me to experiment with their applications in various fields, exploring their diverse roles. 

I firmly believe LLM is not just a tool to simplify our daily tasks but a key driver for **enhancing productivity**, **fostering social equality**, and **combating poverty**. I am certain that AI will be a defining force in the future, shaping every aspect of our lives.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming alone, playing football with my friends, and listening to music. Nature and travel are my escapes, and recently, I've been trying my hand at cooking (trust me, it's an adventure) and soaking up some philosophy books. I treasure my moments of solitude, yet equally enjoy the warm company of my friends.

They say variety is the spice of life, and I'm all for it! I warmly welcome friends from all around the world with different backgrounds to connect and collaborate with me. I'm always open to new ideas and perspectives, so feel free to reach out to me!
