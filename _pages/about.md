Hello and Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Connor Shen, and I hail from the vibrant city of Shanghai, China. Currently, I'm a senior student at Fudan University, where I am studying Physics and Data Science.

As a **die-hard tech optimist**, I am deeply convinced of the revolutionary potential of large language models (LLMs). My enthusiasm leads me to experiment with their applications in various fields, exploring their diverse roles. 

I firmly believe LLM is not just a tool to simplify our daily tasks but a key driver for **enhancing productivity**, **fostering social equality**, and **combating poverty**. I am certain that AI will be a defining force in the future, shaping every aspect of our lives.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming alone, playing football with my friends, and listening to music. Nature and travel are my escapes, and recently, I've been trying my hand at cooking (trust me, it's an adventure) and soaking up some philosophy books. I treasure my moments of solitude, yet equally enjoy the warm company of my friends.

They say variety is the spice of life, and I'm all for it! I warmly welcome friends from all around the world with different backgrounds to connect and collaborate with me. I'm always open to new ideas and perspectives, so feel free to reach out to me!

## Education and Career
#### <img src="{{ '/assets/img/fudan.png' | relative_url }}" width="100" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Fudan University  
* Senior Student
* No. 220 Handan Road, Yangpu District, Shanghai

#### <img src="{{ '/assets/img/ailab.png' | relative_url }}" width="100" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
* Algorithm Intern at OpenMMLab Team
* L1 Building, 8F, Longteng Avenue, Xuhui District, Shanghai

## My Research Interests
* In-context learning & Prompt Engineering
* LLMs Fine-tuning & Application in Various Domains
* Exploring General AI Agents & Human-AI collaboration

## Ongoing Projects
### “Wangdao” Undergraduate Academic Aid Program
* Proposing [KePrompt](https://github.com/Connor-Shen/Knowledge-enhanced-Prompting), a Knowledge-enhanced Prompt Engineering approach, which helps analyze users’ tweets over a period of up to ten years, and assess whether the user's mental state indicates depression.
* Utilizing LLMs as both optimizer and scorer to optimize prompts, while also incorporating human experts as assist scorer. Through iterative rounds, this approach generates the most effective prompt for analyzing depression.
* Employing optimized prompt templates to explore knowledge embedded within LLMs (intrinsic knowledge), and concurrently incorporating expert-provided domain knowledge (extrinsic knowledge) to construct a valuable domain knowledge framework.

### Lagent & ToolBench
* [Lagent](https://github.com/InternLM/lagent) is a lightweight open-source framework that allows users to efficiently build large language model(LLM)-based agents. It also provides some typical tools to augment LLM. 
* Collaboration on the construction of ‘ToolBench’ under the idea of ‘ReAct’, equipping LLMs with a variety of tool APIs to accomplish diverse daily tasks such as composing and sending emails, scheduling activities, and booking hotels.
* Assisting in SFT of our foundational model 'InternLM'.

### OpenCompass Evaluation Platform
* Collaboration on the development of [OpenCompass](https://opencompass.org.cn/), an open-source, efficient, and comprehensive evaluation suite and platform designed for large models.
* Evaluation of LLM's Data Science Capability based on Python libraries.

### PhyBench & PhyTuning 
* **PhyBench** is a dataset built around physics experiment problems, featuring high-quality interactions aimed at improving LLMs' understanding and handling of physics experiment questions.
* **PhyTuning** marks the initial endeavor to instruction-tune LLMs using interaction trajectories from physics experiments, enriched with professional insights and assessments from experiment instructors.
